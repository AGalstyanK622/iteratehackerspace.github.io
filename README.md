-----------------

Make sure you have `node` installed. 

To build the site do:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run build_site`

Then you can just view `index.html` in any browser.

# JavaScript
The project uses ReactJS's `jsx`
and
[bootstrap reimplemented in react](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components.html)
